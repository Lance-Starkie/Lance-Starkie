### Hi there 👋

<!--
I'm a Lance, technical designer specializing specializing in combat and input handling, designing systems and tools to bring gameplay ideas to life. Using Python and GDScript, and tools like the Godot game engine, I have developed a variety of game systems including complex player controllers, combo heavy combat systems, rollback netcode systems, and machine learning agents for enemy behavior.

Much of this is for my upcoming Steam title [Dashwalk Dueling](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1756630/Dashwalk_Dueling/ "Make sure to Wishlist!") so I can't show off too much here yet. 

For 2023 though, I plan to do more Open-Source projects and build on this public profile!

# ⚔ Here are a few of my favorite projects that showcase my skills ⚔

## Tactical Fishing 🎣
Tactical Fishing is a game jam project that explores hunger and starvation in a uniquely limited fishing game with reactive boids. Fish vary in number, from absolute abundance to just a few scattered across the map. The player naturally falls in and out of the fear of starvation until they can no longer keep up.

## Lucifer 🔥
Lucifer is a singleplayer "push forward" combat game that explores combat with the limitation of movement being associated with a commitment to the player's main attack. The gameplay also includes spell cards that add variety to the rushdown-style combat. I had a lot of fun developing the character controller with two floating hands for this project!

## SmashRPS 💪
SmashRPS is a project that generates optimal candidates for rock paper scissors matchups for characters in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. This project was a fun exercise in Python and helped me practice my skills with data analysis and optimization.
