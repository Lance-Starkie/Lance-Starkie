### Hi, I'm Lance! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technical designer with a focus on combat and input handling. I love diving deep into the mechanics, designing systems and tools that make gameplay ideas come alive. My tools of choice are Python, GDScript, and the Godot game engine. Over time, I've crafted a range of game systems, from player controllers and combo-driven combat mechanics to rollback netcode systems and machine learning agents for enemy behavior.

Much of this is for my upcoming Steam title [Dashwalk Dueling](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1756630/Dashwalk_Dueling/ "Make sure to Wishlist!") so I can't show off too much here about it...

For 2023 though, I plan to do more Open-Source projects and build on this public profile!

I also have a [portfolio website](https://lstarkie.dev/) that gets into the nitty gritty of the design behind some of my projects!

# âš” Here are some fun projects that show off my skills âš”

## Tactical Fishing
[Tactical Fishing](https://github.com/Lance-Starkie/Tactical-Fishing) is a game jam project that explores hunger and starvation in a uniquely limited fishing game with reactive boids. Fish vary in number, from absolute abundance to just a few scattered across the map. The player naturally falls in and out of the fear of starvation until they can no longer keep up.

## SmashRPS
[SmashRPS](https://github.com/Lance-Starkie/gejak) is a project that generates optimal candidates for "rock-paper-scissors" style matchups of 3 characters each in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. This project was a fun little exercise in Python and exposed me to data analysis and optimization.

## Gejak Engine
[Gejak](https://github.com/Lance-Starkie/gejak) is an abstract strategy board game that I designed. This an engine to run the game developed as a console program using Python with an AI opponent. I regularly return to this project and [other projects](https://github.com/Lance-Starkie/gejak-digital-board "Board Visualizer") following this board game. I'm excited to continue working on this project and potentially releasing it as a standalone game in the future.

## Fixed Animation Player
This tool, initially crafted for Godot 3.5.1, is my take on a fixed-point deterministic version of the animation player. It's designed to make animations from traditional players compatible with deterministic ones. While it's rooted in Dashwalk Dueling, I've made it open-source, so others can adapt and use it. If you're into Godot and need a deterministic animation solution, give it a whirl! And hey, if you've got improvements, I'm all ears for contributions.
