###Hi, I'm a Lance ðŸ‘‹

technical designer specializing specializing in combat and input handling, designing systems and tools to bring gameplay ideas to life. Using Python and GDScript, and tools like the Godot game engine, I have developed a variety of game systems including complex player controllers, combo heavy combat systems, rollback netcode systems, and machine learning agents for enemy behavior.

Much of this is for my upcoming Steam title [Dashwalk Dueling](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1756630/Dashwalk_Dueling/ "Make sure to Wishlist!") so I can't show off too much here yet. 

For 2023 though, I plan to do more Open-Source projects and build on this public profile!

# âš” Here are some fun projects that show off my skills âš”

## Tactical Fishing ðŸŽ£
[Tactical Fishing](https://github.com/Lance-Starkie/Tactical-Fishing) is a game jam project that explores hunger and starvation in a uniquely limited fishing game with reactive boids. Fish vary in number, from absolute abundance to just a few scattered across the map. The player naturally falls in and out of the fear of starvation until they can no longer keep up.

## SmashRPS ðŸ’ª
[SmashRPS](https://github.com/Lance-Starkie/gejak) is a project that generates optimal candidates for "rock-paper-scissors" style matchups of 3 characters each in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. This project was a fun little exercise in Python and exposed me to data analysis and optimization.

## Gejak Engine â™Ÿ
[Gejak](https://github.com/Lance-Starkie/gejak) is an abstract strategy board game that I designed. This an engine to run the game developed as a console program using Python with an AI opponent. I regularly return to this project and [other projects](https://github.com/Lance-Starkie/gejak-digital-board "Board Visualizer") following this board game. I'm excited to continue working on this project and potentially releasing it as a standalone game in the future.
